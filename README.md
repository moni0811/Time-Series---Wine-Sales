# Time-Series---Wine-Sales
  

## Overview
This project focusing on time series forecasting of 20th-century wine sales data for ABC Estate Wines. The goal was to identify trends, detect seasonality, and provide actionable business recommendations based on historical data patterns.

## Objectives
- Read the data as appropriate Time Series data and plot the data.
- Perform appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and also perform decomposition.
- Split the data into training and test. The test data should start in 1991.
- Build various exponential smoothing models on the training data and evaluate the model using RMSE on the test data. Other models, such as regression, na√Øve forecast models, simple average models etc. should also 
  be built on the training data and check the performance on the test data using RMSE.
- Build a table with all the models built along with the respective RMSE values on the test data.
- Based on the model-building exercise, build the most optimum model(s) on the complete data and predict 12 months into the future
- Comment on the model thus built and report your findings.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Time Series Models (SES, DES,TES, Decomposition)
